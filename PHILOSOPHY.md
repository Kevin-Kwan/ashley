# Ashley's philosophy

## Ashley is not "modern"

Ashley does not aim to be "modern" forum software. The term "modern" is arguably meaningless when it comes to software. However, many new projects claim to be "modern", and consequently established a new category of forum software.

Traditional free forum software such as [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/), [MyBB](https://mybb.com/), and [Simple Machines Forum](https://www.simplemachines.org/) are excellent, widely used, have great ecosystems, and constitute the _de facto_ standard for forum software altogether, with many (if not most) "modern" solutions basing their features on what they pioneered, such as [bbcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode). However, because many developers felt that their technical foundations are antiquated, they engineered new allegedly "modern" solutions using newer technologies, principally newer languages.

These new "modern" forum softwares are indeed written in more accessible languages, but are not necessarily better than their traditional predecessors in terms of functionality. They are notoriously missing many of the aspects that lead to community growth, usually because of their purposeful "thinking out of the box" philosophy that attempts to be needlessly different. They are well-suited to provide a communication platform for specific projects which _already_ have communities (e.g. support platforms, bug trackers, etc.), but are difficult to work with for websites that simply _are_ communities, or _want_ to become a community.

## What Ashley is

Ashley shouldn't exist, but it does because there is a need for a competent option in the current line of "modern" forum software which, ultimately, offers very little. **Ashley is simply a love letter to phpBB and MyBB, written in a "modern" time, and aims to be the most familiar experience to operators of either platform.**

Like traditional forum softwares, Ashley aims to be threaded, with an hierarchical organization of sections and subsections. It has usergroups, a reputation system, built-in support for bbcode, signatures, and shoutboxes. Ashley, however, adds to that what "modern" forum software usually includes, such as support for Markdown, connectivity features (e.g. auto-refreshing pages), account linking (e.g. to Discord, Telegram, GitHub, Twitter/X, etc.), wikis, and mobile support.

## The name

Ashley was named after the WarioWare character [Ashley](https://www.mariowiki.com/Ashley). I started the engineering of this forum software around when WarioWare: Move It! was released and I learned of her name while playing the game, which I used as a codename for the software. Without a better replacement I just rolled with it and it's now the permanent name.
